/*
Write a program that accepts from the user the scores of 3 students in the 4 quizzes and stores these scores in an array. Display the scores of each student.
It should also do the following tasks:
 a. Ask the user to choose whose scores to display (student 1, student 2 or student 3).  
 b. Ask the user to choose a student number, and computes and displays the average score of that student.
 c. Ask the user to choose a quiz number (columns: 1, 2, 3 or 4), it finds the highest score, finds lowest score,  and computes and displays the average score of the specific quiz.

Your program should be menu-driven and includes the following options:
 1. Display all scores
 2. Display the scores of a specific student
 3. Display the average score of a specific student
 4. Display quiz statistics (Find the lowest score, highest score, average score) 

Note:  Make sure to include functions in your program, not just the main function.  

You may consider the following functions:
 a. acceptScores() - accept scores of 3 students in the 4 quizzes and store these into an array
 b. displayStudentScore() - displays the scores of a specific student. It allows the user to input the student number.
 c. displayAllScores() - displays all the scores of all the students
 d. computeStudentAve() - calculates the average score of a specific student.  It allows the user to input the student number.
 e. showQuizStats() - should compute the lowest, highest and average score of a specific quiz.  It allows the user to input the quiz number.
